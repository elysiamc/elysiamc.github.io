			Elysia MC is a modded 1.12.2 Minecraft SMP, with many mods. Create weapons and armour with Tinkers' Construct and Flan's Mod. Or build sprawling industrial complexes with Immersive Engineering. Will you go towards the final frontier with Galacticraft, or will you try your hand at programming with OpenComputers?<br>
