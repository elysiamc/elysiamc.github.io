			Wecome to the Elysia MC website.<br>
			Elysia MC is a modded 1.12.2 Minecraft SMP, with many mods. Create weapons and armour with Tinkers' Construct and Flan's Mod. Or build sprawling industrial complexes with Immersive Engineering. Will you go towards the final frontier with Galacticraft, or will you try your hand at programming with OpenComputers?<br>
			We also have extensive server history and detailed geopolitics, spanning nearly 12 months across. Many people can and have made their mark on this server, and so can you.<br>
			You can get started through this and more by going to the Get Started section and joining the Discord.
