			<h4>Elysia MC Privacy Policy</h4>
			Effective 2 September 2023<br>
			<br>
			Unlike most other websites, Elysia MC actually does care about and is committed to keeping your privacy. By using Elysia MC services, you agree in full to the Privacy Policy.<br><br>
			<b>0. Definitions</b><br>
			We define information as any digital storage, message, or other medium that contains any data that can be read and interpreted, either by machine or by a human. (simply, stuff on a computer/server.)<br>
			Processing of information is interacting with information, such as transferring, reading, modifying, or collecting it. (simply, doing things with information.)<br>
			A third party is anything that is not Elysia MC itself. Third-party (with the hyphen) is an adjective describing something as not operated by Elysia MC itself.<br>
			<br>
			<b>1. How we use your data</b><br>
			The Elysia MC Minecraft server processes and stores your Minecraft username and UUID. This is recorded in server logs and in other server files. Server logs record anything you type and send to the Minecraft server chat, and are gathered for administrative purposes (such as to identify possible rule violations). UUIDs are used to identify your Minecraft account to store your in-game inventory and other stats.<br>
			The Elysia MC wiki records your input (when editing articles) and your IP address if you are not logged in. Your input is used for displaying data. Your IP address is used to attribute your changes (this will not be done if you are logged in). This is done automatically by MediaWiki and any information collected cannot be processed by Elysia MC directly.<br>
			The Elysia MC website does not process information, nor does it have the capabilities to receive it.<br>
			All applicable information is retained indefinitely. You may request to have your Minecraft Server info deleted.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2. Third parties</b><br>
			Elysia MC hosts its services on third-party platforms, which may process your information in their own ways. We recommend you check out their own privacy policies for more information.<br>
			The exhaustive list of third-party services we use are <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">Minecraft (Microsoft)</a>, <a href="https://cohost.org/rc/content/privacy">cohost (ASSC)</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy">Miraheze</a>. Elysia MC also use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Privacy_policy#introduction">MediaWiki (WikiMedia)</a>, and <a href="https://pebblehost.com/legal#Privacy%20Policy">PebbleHost</a>, but these are hosting services as opposed to platforms, and (to the extent of our knowledge) do not collect information.<br>
			The service names have been hyperlinked to their respective Privacy Policy page.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3. Update to the Privacy Policy</b><br>
			Elysia MC may update this Privacy Policy. As per the GDPR, we are required to inform you of any revisions. By continuing to use Elysia MC's services, you accept to these revisions.<br>
			<br>
			<b>4. Request of Information</b><br>
			As per the GDPR, we must give you a copy of all the information we have on you. This is not reccommended though, as you will simply be given your Minecraft username and UUID, the former you already know, and the latter can easily be found using an online tool. Wiki info will not be given as Elysia MC cannot access the info directly.<br>
			You can also request a deletion of your information through the same means.<br>
			<br>
			<b>5. Contact</b><br>
			Contact information with regards to your data or privacy in general can be found on the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.
