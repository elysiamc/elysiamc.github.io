So you've decided to play on Elysia MC. Welcome! There are a few steps you need to do before you can get on, though.
			<h4>1 - Checking your system</h4>
			The first thing you need to do is to check your system's specs - that is - the CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and operating system. If you know your specs, you can skip to the system requirements.<br>
			<br>
			First off - if you have Android or iOS, then sorry, you can't play unless you want to turn your phone into a makeshift bomb. While yes, you can play Elysia MC on Pojav Launcher, the amount of CPU and RAM that Elysia MC takes is so much, your phone most likely cannot handle it.<br>
			Console players are also unable to play - as Java Edition mods do not work on consoles.<br>
			<br>
			Once confirming that you have a PC, you now have to figure out the specs.<br>
			Identifying your operating system is easy: if your computer has the Apple logo, it runs macOS, if not, it uses Windows. You will know if you have Linux.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Windows</strong><br>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to your desktop and press Win + R. In the popup window, type tskmgr, then hit Enter.</li>
				<li>In the Task Manager, click Performance.</li>
				<li>Task Manager should show you the CPU. On the top right of the window, you will be able to see your CPU name.</li>
				<li>Click on the tabs on the left to get the names for your GPU, RAM, and storage (this may be called SSD or HDD).</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<strong>macOS</strong><br>
			<ol>
				<li>On the desktop, click the Apple icon, then click About This Mac.</li>
				<li>To check your CPU, GPU, and RAM, beside the picture.</li>
				<li>To check your avaliable storage, click the Storage tab on the window and hover your cursor over the white bar.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<strong>Linux</strong><br>
			Checking your specs on a Linux machine differs depending on your distro.<br>
			A good way to check your RAM, GPU, and CPU is through the neofetch command.<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Open your terminal and type the following:</li>
				<li>sudo apt update<br>
				sudo apt install neofetch<br>
				neofetch<br>
				</li>
				<li>To find your storage, you should look how to do so on the Internet for your particular distro.</li>
				Compare your specs to the table below (generally, a bigger number is better. You can use comparison websites to compare each spec individually (stay away from userbenchmark.com)).<br>
				Minimum specs are for the specs need to run Elysia at a playable quality, while the reccommended specs are those needed to play it at a comfortable quality.<br>

			<h4>2 - Installing and playing Elysia</h4>
			First off, you need to install either CurseForge itself or a launcher with CurseForge integration, like PolyMC or GDLauncher.<br>
			Depending on your launcher, click "New Instance" and then click CurseForge. Type in "Elysia: A World Reshapen".<br>
			The correct modpack is the one with that exact title, authoured by ZeBoss07, and of version 1.3. Older versions will not work, and newer versions mean you're on the wrong modpack (or this is outdated).<br>
			Once you have it installed, load up Minecraft, then click Multiplayer then New Server. The IP is play.elysiamc.tk.
			<h4>3 - Once you're in</h4>
			It's best you join a country, which you can find out on the Discord.<br>
			You should also check the mods out- either by the wiki, the Internet, or an Engineer's Manual, for machines.<br>
